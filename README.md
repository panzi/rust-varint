varint
======

Just some experiments to make wrapping integers of arbitrary bit size (<= 128 bits).
There are not tests -> **DO NOT USE!**

**Note:*** The way this is written for each of all 128 bits makes this really
slow to compile.

TODO
----

* [x] varuint
* [ ] varint (sign bit handling!)
* [ ] turn into library
* [ ] tests
